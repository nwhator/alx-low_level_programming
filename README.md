# [alx-low_level_programming](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming)
This repository contains projects completed as part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum. The projects cover topics such as basic data types, flow control, functions, pointers, arrays, and structures in the C programming language.

## Directories
The repository is organized into the following directories:

### [0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world)
This directory contains introductory projects to the C programming language. The projects include writing a script to print "Hello, World!" and writing a C program that prints a quote, followed by a new line, to the standard error.

### [0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while)
This directory contains projects that introduce the use of variables, loops, and conditional statements in the C programming language. The projects include writing a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, writing a program that prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, and writing a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.

### [0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops)
This directory contains projects that introduce the concept of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. The projects include writing a function that prints the multiplication table of a number, writing a program that prints the numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal, and writing a function that checks for the uppercase characters.

### [0x03-debugging](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging)
This directory contains projects that introduce debugging techniques in the C programming language. The projects include fixing code that produces unexpected output, fixing code that goes into an infinite loop, and fixing code that produces segmentation faults.

### [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
This directory contains projects that further explore the concept of functions and nested loops in the C programming language. The projects include writing a function that checks for a digit, writing a function that multiplies two integers, and writing a function that prints a square followed by a new line.

### [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
This directory contains projects that introduce pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. The projects include writing a function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to, writing a function that swaps the values of two integers, and writing a function that prints a string in reverse.

### [0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
This directory contains projects that further explore pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. The projects include writing a function that concatenates two strings, writing a function that copies a string, and writing a function that converts a string to an integer.

### [0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
This directory contains projects more on pointers, arrays and strings

### [0x08-recursion](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x08-recursion)
This directory contains projects that introduce recursion in the C programming language. The projects include writing a function that returns the factorial of a given number, writing a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y, and writing a function that returns the natural square root of a number.

### [0x09-static_libraries](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x09-static_libraries)
This directory contains projects that introduce static libraries in the C programming language. The projects include writing a script that creates a static library from a set of C files and using the library to compile a C program.

### [0x0A-argc_argv](https://github.com/nwhator/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x0A-argc_argv)
This directory contains projects that introduce the use of command-line arguments in the C programming language. The projects include writing a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it and writing a program that prints all arguments it receives.

### 0x0A-malloc_free
This directory contains projects that introduce dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language. The projects include writing a function that creates an array of integers, writing a function that concatenates two strings using malloc, and writing a program that frees malloc memory.

### 0x0B-more_malloc_free
This directory contains projects that further explore dynamic memory allocation in the C programming language. The projects include writing a function that allocates memory
